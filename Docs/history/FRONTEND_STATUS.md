# Frontend Status

## ✅ What's Built

### Phase 2: Customer Management UI
- ✅ **CustomerForm** component - Create/edit customers
- ✅ **CustomerList** component - View/search customers
- ✅ **App.jsx** - Main app with customer management
- ✅ **Vite setup** - Ready to run
- ✅ **Styling** - CSS files included

### Current Frontend Features:
1. ✅ Create new customers
2. ✅ View customer list
3. ✅ Search customers
4. ✅ See customer details (coordinates, airport)

## ❌ What's Missing

### Not Yet Built:
- ❌ Trip planning UI
- ❌ Cost calculation display
- ❌ Trip list/view
- ❌ Navigation/routing
- ❌ Quotation generation UI

## 🚀 How to Test Current Frontend

### Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on: **http://localhost:3001**

### What You Can Test:
1. **Customer Management**
   - Create new customers
   - View customer list
   - Search customers
   - See geocoded coordinates (if API key works)

### Current Limitations:
- Only customer management is available
- No trip planning UI yet
- No cost calculation UI yet
- No navigation between pages

## 📋 Next Steps for Frontend

To complete the frontend, we need to add:

1. **Trip Planning Page**
   - Create trip form
   - Select customers
   - Set dates and work hours
   - View calculated costs

2. **Trip List Page**
   - View all trips
   - Filter by status/type
   - View trip details

3. **Navigation**
   - Add React Router
   - Navigation menu
   - Page routing

4. **Cost Display**
   - Show cost breakdown
   - Display calculated costs
   - Cost comparison view

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Option 1: Test Current Frontend**
- Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- Test customer management features
- Verify API integration works

**Option 2: Build Complete Frontend**
- Add trip planning UI
- Add navigation
- Add cost display
- Complete the user experience

Would you like me to:
1. Test the current frontend (customer management only)?
2. Build the complete frontend with trip planning UI?
